# HTTP 2 MQTT
Simple HTTP request to MQTT message bridge (relay).

## Usage
This package is available on docker hub as [hertzg/ht2mq](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hertzg/ht2mq/general).
Project was targeted towards being run inside docker, but you can also start it without.

Lets assume you started the service and have the accessible at `http://ht2mq-bridge.svc.local`.
```
$ docker run -p 80:8080 -e MQTT_BROKER=mqtt://mqtt.svc.local hertzg/ht2mq:latest
```

### HTTP GET
```
$ curl -X GET http://ht2mq-bridge.svc.local/my/sample/topic?payload_goes_here_directly
{"topic":"my/sample/topic","payload":"payload_goes_here_directly","result":{"success":true}}
```

### HTTP POST
```
$ curl -X POST http://ht2mq-bridge.svc.local/my/sample/topic -d payload_goes_here_directly
{"topic":"my/sample/topic","payload":"payload_goes_here_directly","result":{"success":true}}
```

### HTTP `*` (Payload in header)
```
curl -X POST http://ht2mq-bridge.svc.local/my/sample/topic -H "X-Payload: payload_goes_here_directly"
{"topic":"my/sample/topic","payload":"payload_goes_here_directly","result":{"success":true}}
```

**Note**: The response DOES NOT  contian the prefix, but it will be added when actual publish happens.

### Precedence
In cases where requests match multiple or all usecases (eg: sending a post request with payload in query string, header and body) the payload that will be forwarded to mqtt is baed on the following precedence:

1. Header (`x-payload`)
2. Query String (`?payload_goes_here`)
3. Body (http request body)
